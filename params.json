The system is scalable and does not suffer from bottlenecks due to network communication. This system will also implement GPU computation support using Rootbeer.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nA space-worker compute system have one or many centralized spaces. A lot of tasks and data are being send to, from and through these spaces which makes the system vulnerable if one should fail. There are ways to handle a failed space but the process can be complicated. One approach is to let a worker step in as a space and receive a backup state from another space. This is not often a good solution because workers can have different hardware than spaces and might not be that centralized in the physical network. \r\n\r\nIn a P2P compute system the communication between the peers is equal, which means no bottlenecks. Since all computers are treated the same and behaves the same the result of a failing peer will only result in reduced computational power of one computer. Because of the simple topology of P2P networks this compute system will be very easy to set up and can be very scalable.\r\n\r\n## Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n* The network starts with a single peer which starts its own network. Other peers can connect to the network by sending a connect message to any peer in the network given by IP and port. There is no notion of a tracker or a centralized system for handling connects and failures.\r\n\r\n* The failure of a peer will be detected when a communication attempt fails and a RMI exception is thrown\r\nWorkload will be distributed evenly between peers and their workers by keeping a short work queue and making peers request more work from random peers in the network \r\n- Test by spawning large TSP task, make sure that all peers have enough work at all times. The goal is to make this system utilize processing power better than the system that was made in homework 5.\r\n\r\n* A peers task is backed up in one other peer at all times. When one of those peers fails or disconnects another backup will be made immediately. This task must be reassigned if the computing peer fails. \r\n- Run three peers, repeatedly crash a task which is currently computing a task. Make sure that the task is reassigned and computed correctly.\r\nPeers are able to solve Rootbeer tasks\r\n\r\n## Performance Requirements\r\n\r\nThe performance of the system will be tested by running three kinds of tasks; TSP, Mandelbrot and Fibonacci computations. The goal is that the peer to peer system should compute these tasks faster than what has been achieved in the homework tasks in the course. The performance of the homework compute system is well documented and should be easily comparable to the measurement from the peer to peer system. \r\n\r\nWhen we push the number of machines and cores in the network we expect to see better results than from the homework since the space became a bottle neck in the system. The peer to peer network has no such bottle neck and should be able to handle the massive amount of message passing better.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Key Technical Issues\r\n\r\n* Making the system consistent when faced with failing machines and randomly disconnecting peers\r\n\r\n* Distributing workload as efficiently as possible\r\n\r\n* Getting better performance than a similar space-worker system when the number of machines and cores is large\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n* The peer to peer system will have no central authority, all peers are equal.\r\n\r\n* All peers can talk to all other peers whenever they want to. It is possible to send messages to specific peers or simply a broadcast to all peers.All peers keeps references to all the other peers in the network.\r\n\r\n* Worload will be distributed by making the peers that are running out of work ask other random peers for more work. It will then take possible available work from the queue of other peers.\r\n\r\n* The task system supports DAC and the ability to share a variable between the workers.\r\n\r\n* The shared variable will be broadcasted to all peers which will update their variable if it is \"newer\" than the one they already have.\r\n\r\n* This project will be realized as an API which people can use to distribute their computations on a distributed cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Experiments\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n## Conclusions [and Future Work]\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nTODO","name":"P2P and Rootbeer"}
